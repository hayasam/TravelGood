## 02267 Software Development of Web Services  Examination project

TravelGood is a travel agency providing a set of Web services to plan and book trips which are composed
of flights and hotel bookings. These Web services are used by Web sites (e.g. offered by the travel agency
itself) and by client applications, e.g. stand alone PC applications used by the consultants working in
the offices of TravelGood.

To cater for different types of clients, TravelGood offers its services both, as SOAP/BPEL based
Web services and as REST services. While it would make sense to base one implementation of the Web
services on the other, management has decided to implement REST services and SOAP/BPEL Web
services separate from each other. The project is intended to act as a pilot project to find the strengths
and weaknesses of each of the types of Web services.

TravelGood works together with an airline reservation agency called LameDuck and a hotel reservation
agency called NiceView. Both offer their services only as traditional SOAP based Web services.
TravelGood and the other companies use the bank FastMoney for credit card payment and money transfer,
which offers its services as SOAP based Web services.
